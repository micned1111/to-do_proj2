# To-Do List Application

A simple and interactive To-Do List application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, while storing them in the browser’s localStorage for persistence across sessions. 

I mainly used this project to continue working on JS, especially using arrow-functions and writing 
a bit more compact code. This project is similar in both functionality and style from freeCodeCamp´s
JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures – course, due to the fact that i made this project around 
the same time as I completed that task in freeCodeCamp, but the important part here is that I did 
not copy and paste. 


## Description
The To-Do List app helps users manage their daily tasks in a clear and efficient way.  
It emphasizes **core JavaScript concepts** like DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, and persistence with localStorage.  

This was created as a personal project to practice **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) without a backend.  


## Features
- Add new tasks to the list  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete individual tasks  
- Data persistence using localStorage (tasks remain after refreshing the page)  

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/micned1111/to-do_proj2
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd to-do_proj2
3. Open **index.html** in your preferred web browser


## Tech Stack
* HTML – structure
* CSS – styling (very basic)
* JavaScript – logic and interactivity


## Future Improvements
* Add categories or tags for tasks
* Sort/filter tasks (completed vs active)
* Option to sync tasks with a backend
